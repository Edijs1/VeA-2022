            <p><em>The Simpsons</em> </p>
            <p>The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.
                The series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists
                of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.
                The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture and society,
                television, and the human condition.
                The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with
                producer James L. Brooks.
                He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting
                Bart for his own name;
                he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to "simpleton". The shorts became a part
                of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987.
                After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first
                series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990). </p>

                    Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he
                    cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.</p>

                    Aside from her duties at home, Marge has flirted briefly with a number of careers ranging from a
                    police officer to an anti-violence activist. </p>
