                <p><em>Neco Arc</em> is a member of the Neco Spirit race, originating from the Great Cat's Village. She became Ms. Ciel's student, constantly acting up in retaliation for having such little screen time and wishing people to think she is smart. She is referred to as the "work of Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg" according to Aoko Aozaki, suggesting she was brought from another world, but it's also said that there is a "certain urban legend" telling of six Neco-Arcs and one that exceeds them that could be a materialization of TATARI.</p>

                    <p>Neco Arc is known as the biggest small-fry in the Cat Kingdom. Most characters are unnerved by her appearance, and she especially torments White Len, calling her a "tsundere", and Satsuki Yumizuka, who Neko-Arc constantly reminds that she doesn't have a major role in Tsukihime. She recognizes Miyako Arima as a much-awaited future rival.</p>

                    <p>Much like Neco-Arc, he is mostly nonsensical, spouting off non sequitur statements and breaking the fourth wall. When not manic, he acts suave and smokes a cigarette.</p>

                    <p>Destiny is somewhat of a drama queen, and often cries about things like 'love and money' or 'we all look the same' in relation to the other Neco Spirits at Ahnenerbe. She tends to be lost in sentimental thoughts related to romance and womanhood, similar to Neco-Arc Chaos who frequently ponders life and manhood.</p>
