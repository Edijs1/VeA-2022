                <h1>Seven Warlords of the Sea</h1>
                <img src="CommandOfSevenWarlords.png" alt="Command of Seven Warlords of the Sea Image">
                <p><em>Comand of Seven Warlords of the Sea</em> or simply the Seven Warlords, were a selection of seven powerful and notorious pirates allied to the World Government. Collectively, they constituted one of the Three Great Powers that kept the world in balance. After two members (Crocodile and Donquixote Doflamingo) had their titles stripped for heinous public crimes, Marine Admiral Fujitora led a campaign to abolish the Seven Warlords system. He achieved this goal during the most recent Levely, as the council of rulers voted to abolish the system; the five remaining Warlords at the time immediately had their bounties unfrozen and became enemies of the World Government once again.</p>

After staying behind in Totto Land to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the Wano Country Arc, officially announcing his status as a member of the crew. He first gained a bounty of  76,000,000 due to him being a member of the Sun Pirates. It was later increased to  250,000,000 after Jinbe became the new captain of the Sun Pirates before it was frozen after he joined the Seven Warlords. Upon resigning his position as a Warlord at the Summit War of Marineford, his bounty was reinstated at  438,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to  1,100,000,000.</p>

Once feared as an extremely vicious pirate, earning himself the title "Tyrant", he is now a human weapon called a "Pacifista", developed by the scientist Vegapunk. Once Vegapunk finished his modifications on Kuma, the Warlord was converted into the first complete Pacifista cyborg, with the serial PX-0, and mentally died in the process. After protecting the Thousand Sunny for 2 years, Kuma became a slave-to-rent for the World Nobles as punishment until his fellow revolutionaries freed him. The Straw Hat Pirates had an encounter with him during the Thriller Bark Arc and later during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, where he was responsible for separating the crew. He is also a major antagonist in the Marineford Arc where he took part in the Summit War of Marineford and sided with the Marines, along with most of the other Warlords.</p>
