		 <p><em>Fast Five</em> is a 2011 action film written by Chris Morgan and directed by Justin Lin. It is the fifth installment in the Fast and the
			Furious film series, being the second film of the second trilogy.</p>
		 <p>When developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, 
			to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars.</p>
		 <p>By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture.
		 Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such
		 as gun fights, brawls and the heist of $100 million.</p>
		 <p>The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile
		 manufacturers and at NASCAR races.</p>
