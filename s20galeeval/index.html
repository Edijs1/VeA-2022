                <p><em>Beretta</em> Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta (Italian pronunciation: [ˈfabbrika ˈdarmi ˈpjɛːtro
                    beˈretta]; "Pietro Beretta Weapon Factory") is a privately held Italian firearms manufacturing
                    company
                    operating in several countries. Its firearms are used worldwide for a variety of civilian, law
                    enforcement, and military purposes. Sporting arms account for three-quarters of sales; Beretta is
                    also
                    known for marketing shooting clothes and accessories. Founded in the 16th century, Beretta is the
                    oldest
                    active manufacturer of firearm components in the world.[1] In 1526 its inaugural product was
                    arquebus
                    barrels; by all accounts Beretta-made barrels equipped the Venetian fleet at the Battle of Lepanto
                    in
                    1571.[2] Beretta has supplied weapons for every major European war since 1650.[3]</p>

                    <p>It combines style and classic engraving with unsurpassed performance. Strong enough to withstand
                        countless days of serious competition, this elegant gun facilitates the rapid target acquisition
                        that’s imperative in this discipline. Elegant, hand-finished floral motifs adorn the receiver.
                        The fully adjustable Memory System Skeet stock and beavertail fore-end are crafted from
                        beautifully grained walnut.</p>

                    <p>Designed and tested in collaboration with the Beretta Shooting Team, 694 is the new
                        over-and-under
                        platform designed specifically for competition shooting, with a precise objective in mind: to
                        help
                        shooters increase their success rate.
                        Thanks to a meticulous mechanical and ergonomic design process, the 694 represents a perfectly
                        balanced over-and-under competition shotgun. Natural and immediate when shouldering, it features
                        a
                        precise swing and it’s easy to control.
                        The new shape of the action and the stock provide increased field of vision, while the new
                        forend
                        iron system allows the user to maintain the opening load constant over time, and the Steelium
                        Plus
                        barrels guarantee a dense, uniform pattern every time.</p>

                    <p>The ergonomics of the stock has been completely redesigned to provide the ideal configuration for
                        every discipline. The first new feature is the way the action is bedded into the stock, where
                        the
                        profile of the action is accompanied by two progressive grooves, thus reducing the presence of
                        obstacles in the field of view when shouldering the gun: this important development helps the
                        shooter to avoid having to raise his/her head from the line of sight, a movement that often
                        results
                        in a "zero".
                        The trap version is available with a 29/39 and 35/45 drop, and the latter also features a B-Fast
                        adjustable comb and a round or beaver-tail forend. </p>
